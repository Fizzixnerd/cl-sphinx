An Overview of the cl-pocketsphinx Architecture

* Object Mapping Philosophy

  The philosophy is to import all data structures into the Lisp
  environment as classes, and to synchronize Lisp-based modifications
  to them using :AFTER methods defined on SETF SLOT-VALUEs.

  The reason to import them to the Lisp environment is to aid in
  introspection, interactive development, and debugging.

  A drawback of this design is that if cl-pocketsphinx is used as a
  scripting layer for a C program: if C data changes after import,
  this will not be reflected in the Lisp environment.
